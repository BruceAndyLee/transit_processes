# Transit processes

This program was built as a meta project for some Uni's course work.
The deal with the course work to build a chain of signal modifiers and analyze the resulting signal, namely what said chain does to different types of transients (e.g. a linear rise, a jump and a negative squared rise)

And yeah, I have absolutely no memory of how to start up a C# interface.
